## FIN1: Stock prices are just the sum of all the money investors think a company will ever make.
I used to wonder why stocks moved substantially after earnings announcements, but less for product announcements. Now I know: It’s because the stock price is meant to reflect the value of a company. One way to think about “value” is as **the sum of all the money a company will make, forever.** Earnings announcements are a great predictor for those cash flows.

The cool part is that you can do the calculations yourselves if if you have a copy of an income statement and balance sheet and some comparable companies to reference. The technique is called a Discounted Cash Flow, or [DCF](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp), and the main idea behind it is that cash now is worth more than cash later. By building it, you can decide for yourself if a stock is under, over, or fairly valued.

One quick trick to evaluate stocks without building a full DCF is to use something called a [multiple.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiple.asp) This is how many of my peers prefer to evaluate stocks.

## FIN2: Technical debt ~= Financial debt.

It turns out there isn’t much difference between how financial debt works and how technical debt works.
Working in industry, I’d always gotten the idea that we couldn’t quantify the impacts of technical debt — in terms of how long it takes us to add additional things, how much time we should spend fixing it, etc.
It turns out that isn’t necessarily true. Carliss Baldwin is doing research that models technical debt and can help companies make tradeoffs about fixing it now vs. fixing it later. Here’s [an early paper of her research in technical debt.](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7262.html)

## LEAD: Understand your Worst Self.

People often know what they’re good at (it got them where they are!) Unfortunately, things won’t always go well in your career. How you react and recover impacts everyone around you.

One of the best things I did this year was answering these two questions honestly, for myself:
- What is my worst self?
- When does my worst self come out?

My worst self: critical, impatient, stubborn, cynical, and sarcastic. It comes out when I feel like I’m not in a position to make an impact, and when I feel undervalued in a situation. It also happens if I think I’m fundamentally “right” and someone disagrees. If it goes on for too long I become incredibly apathetic and don’t do anything.

I have a hard time avoiding this, but I am better at catching it now. When I do catch it, I attempt to apologize to the group, move on, and catch it faster the next time.

## TOM: Figure out Why.

Figuring out what the limiting step is and why is like a math puzzle. The best thing about it was that sometimes a simple problem delays an entire operation — the slowest step is the one that matters, but it screws everything else up. Being able to figure out what’s going wrong is important. Often times there’s a ton of complicated data that makes it hard to figure out what’s wrong.

I’d point to two cases that you can use to test your ability to do this:
1. [National Cranberry Collective](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=21752) for Process Flow
2. [Toyota Production System](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=6524) to see the same concepts at a larger scale.

## FRC: Create an Entrepreneurial Gap.

My favorite was the idea of “span of accountability” — what an employee is responsible for vs. “span of control” — what the employee can dictate based on their job. For instance, a PM has a lot of accountability (shipping the product), but relatively little control (no direct reports).

When an employee has more accountability than control, this is considered an “entrepreneurial gap.” It’s typically created via an incentive system that encourages the employee to go beyond their span of control. The key thing is to get the incentive system right. What behaviors will it encourage? What levers can employees pull to move the metric?

Before I wanted to hire smart people and pay them “fairly.” Now I want to hire smart people, and give them an entrepreneurial gap with an incentive system that works well for them and for the company. It’s more fair that way.

If you want a second lesson, I also really enjoyed the [Boston Children’s Hospital time vs. activity based costing.](https://hbr.org/product/boston-children-s-hospital-measuring-patient-costs/112086-PDF-ENG) It’s all about getting into how much things really cost and better cost measurement.

## MKT: Consider Value-Based Pricing.

There are two primary types of pricing: Cost-Based and Value-Based. In Cost Based pricing, you figure out how much it costs you to provide a service. Then you add a mark up and use that price to sell to the customer.

The idea behind value pricing is that there’s actually a much wider wedge between the two things:
- First, there’s the amount your Product costs to make.
- Then, there’s the amount your Product saves the other company (or how much more it allows them to sell — but basically the financial impact giving your product has).

You should charge somewhere between those two points.

As much as I’m never going to charge to the very top of that spectrum, I know that I need to write down both pieces to make sure I’m not undercharging.

The case on this was a [Coca-Cola vending machine](https://hbr.org/product/Coca-Cola-s-New-Vending-M/an/500068-PDF-ENG), but my favorite case in the pricing module was about [pricing the London Olympics.](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=37854)

## TEM: Be careful who you trust.

We did a case on [YieldEx](https://hbr.org/product/yieldex-a/an/809090-PDF-ENG), a startup founded by an Engineer who was considering an offer to sell or an offer to raise another round. You can easily deduce that they didn’t sell at the time: [YieldEx was recently acquired by AppNexus.](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/18/appnexus-buys-yieldex-for-100-million/)

Without sharing case details: There were a couple distinctly different attitudes in the room. I genuinely try to give advice that helps the person who asks me, removing my personal interest. I try to assume the best of others, and thus think they do similarly for me.

While my belief was prevalent in the room, there was also a counter view of “the world works best if you serve your own interest and everyone should believe that others are self-serving.”

The discussion definitely impacted how I view advice from others on my career. Potential cofounders and VCs may have your best interests at heart: and they also may not. Read the situation carefully.

## STRAT: Financial Statements reveal Strategies.

Strategy is all about: the dynamics of an industry, and the way firms position themselves within the industry.

The most interesting thing you can do is look at financial statements to see where competitive advantages are coming from. Lower costs of production? Lower admin costs? If a firm has a low cost strategy, do they spend a lot in one area? Which? Why might that be, and how does it play into the overall strategy?

Examining a financial statement gives you way more about strategy than I ever would have guessed.

This is super clear in the [Walmart Case.](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=23386)

## BGIE: The same political topics come up everywhere.

Doing 20+ cases on countries and politics taught me one important thing: there’s a lot of similarity between different politics situations. It’s not too hard to brush up on the basics so you can maintain a conversation about international affairs.

One of those things is the GUIDES indicators that focus on some overall macroeconomic indicators.

A few other topics that get you a lot of bang for the buck: British Colonialism, Nations vs. States, Dutch Disease (Resource Curse), Sovereign Wealth Fund, Import Substitution, Current Account Balance, Fiscal Deficit, IMF austerity measures, and the “Trilemma” of Free Capital Flows, Independent Monetary policy, and Fixed Exchange rates.

These topics came up throughout the world: from [Iceland](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=36431) to [Indonesia](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=35170) to [Nigeria](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=37018. They’re worth learning, even just to avoid staring in silence during dinner parties.

## LCA: My gut might be wrong.
The role of Leadership and Corporate Accountability is much like an ethics class. Throughout the class, we develop frameworks for considering the implications of a choice: financially, legally, and ethically.

Many people make these choices about right or wrong based on “gut feeling” (myself included). LCA teaches you to evaluate using frameworks to make sure you’ve thought through everything. Things get harder first, and only then can you use your gut.

A good example is[ this case on an insurgent situation in Iraq.](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=39930) You might be tempted to make one call when you first read it, and change your mind as you keep reflecting.

This class, and frankly this entire piece, is best summed up by this quote often attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.:

> I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity. — Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
