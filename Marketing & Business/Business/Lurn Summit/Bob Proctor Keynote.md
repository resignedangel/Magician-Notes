## What are your goals?

- **Write them down** and **start thinking about how to achieve them**
- *Read Think And Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill

> Experience is the best teacher

> It's the start that stops most people.

- Take responsibility for your results
- Believe in yourself
- Paradigm = program in your subconscious mind
- Your paradigm dictates your reality
- Earliest years of life = all subconscious programming
- Paradigm changing -> constant exposure to empowering information and people -> a paradigm is a **multitude of habits**
- You know better than what you're doing
- You know you can do better
- All it takes -> change 1-2 habits
- Question your beliefs
- Change your beliefs through repetition
- Operate with faith, not fear
- Both demand you believe in something you can't see
- *Why choose fear?*
