> It’s like goals served in a fractal manner. — Eric, founder of Pebble

Do you ever wonder how successful companies continue to navigate and grow? I often wondered how the companies I admired knew what direction to go — and it became apparent that** the trick was being almost irresponsibly aggressive in growing key objectives with a talented group of people.**

## What are OKRs?

OKR is an abbreviation for **Objective & Key Result**. The concept was invented at the Intel Corporation and is widely used amongst the biggest technology companies in the world including Google and Zynga.

OKRs are meant to set strategy and goals over a specified amount of time for an organization and teams. At the end of a work period, your OKRs provide a reference to evaluate how well you did in executing your objectives.

Spending a concerted effort in identifying your company strategy and laying it out in a digestible way with OKRs can truly help your employees see how they are contributing to the big picture and align with other teams.

### Objectives

Any initiative has an objective. The goal of setting an objective is to write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective.

Choosing the right objectives is one of the hardest things to do and requires a great deal of thinking and courage to do well.

### Key Results

Assuming your Objectives are well thought through, Key Results are the secret sauce to using OKRs. Key Results are *numerically-based* expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.

> Expectations that are numerically defined produce results that can be quantitatively measured and scored.

The important element here is measuring success. It’s not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well you are succeeding. **Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.**

e.g If I create a goal to “launch new training for the sales team” I might do that for one sales member. If I alternatively make a Key Result of “train 50 sales team members” and only train 10, I’ve still 10x-ed my original goal.

### Example — Uber

There is this wonderful paper napkin plan of Uber’s path to growth. When I first saw it, it made so much sense:

How can OKRs help make this function real?

They apply a numerical framework to this growth strategy so teams know what’s important and what to drive:

**Objective: Increase Drivers in System**
- Increase driver base in each region by 20%
- Increase driver average session to 26 hours / weekly in all active regions


**Objective: Increase Geographic Coverage of Drivers**
- Increase coverage of SF to 100%
- Increase coverage for all active cities to 75%
- Decrease pickup time to < 10 mins in any coverage area during peak hours of usage


**Objective: Increase Driver Happiness**
- Define and measure driver happiness score
- Increase driver happiness score to 75th percentile

Applying numerical goals to areas of importance means:
1. We communicate what’s important to the company
2. We apply easily understood goals with numerical success criteria
3. We begin to measure based on our goals as opposed to raw organic (or paid) growth.


Solving how these OKRs are met is up to the talented teams and individuals at Uber who think about this day in and out.

### Example — YouTube

Say your goal is to increase the total usage time of Google products. The tricky part is finding the right metrics in which to progress. Understanding your business is key in being able to identify key growth nuances and folding those nuances into company objectives.

Similar to Facebook, YouTube wants viewership, measured in minutes, to go up because a fixed percentage of that viewership is ads. So as total time goes up so do revenues, predictably.

*Objective: Increase average watch time per user.*

Assuming you’ve been tracking watch time the key results could be to:

- *Increase total viewership time to XX minutes daily*
- *Expand native YT application to 2 new OSs*
- *Reduce video loading times by X%*

In this case the Key Results may reveal part of the strategy to increase watch time. The first key result sets a numerical goal to hit for the objective. Having this number is crucial (and theoretically could be included in the objective itself) to score the outcome of this objective.

If the key result is reached easily the number was not aggressive enough. Alternatively if the goal is attempted and falls well short it’s important to revise expectations in the next round of OKRs.

> It is recommended to always shoot for stretch objectives. If you are consistently hitting your goals you are undershooting your capabilities. At Google, we strive to achieve a 0.7 score of our stated Objectives.

The Key Results are flexible to allow for a number of solutions. Sometimes they embed the plan for reaching the objective:

One option is to expand the Serviceable Obtainable Market by adding Windows phone users who then would add to watch time.

Users might have been shown to not watch videos if they take too long to load, or have unpredictable uptime. Thus YouTube might make serious investments to reduce loading times by supporting edge caches of video. In these scenarios a Key Result might need to become it’s own separate Objective to fully capture the requirements.

> OKRs represent a devilishly simple communication tool. If used well you will be responsible for incredible progress.

## OKRs as a communication framework

As you might have guessed by now, effective OKRs are widely shared and meant to be understood by teams and individuals.

In that regard, they can serve as a communication framework for directing groups to solve complex challenges with constraints. As a communication tool, OKRs bring two key things to an organization:
- Easily digestible direction such that every member in the organization understands how they contribute to the mission; aka focus
- Expectations amongst teams and their individual members; aka accountability

Defining measurable results becomes easier as you learn what you should be measuring and what ultimately matters for your business. In my work with founders **I find that the quality of OKRs has a good correlation with their understanding of their business.** Blindly going for growth without understanding the reasons behind specific metrics (revenue drivers, hypothesis testing) can be damning.

I began to use the OKR framework to help my friends’ startups, which varied in size from 4–100+ people, because of the tool’s practicality and straightforwardness. I found my friends running into two challenges as their companies grew:
- What should we do next — and how do we know if it’s working?
- What is an effective way to align the organization towards a common goal? (aka: better direction setting)

In the first scenario OKRs forces the measurement of any company endeavor. Ideally this optimizes the input efforts because things that are working will be continued (and grow in scope), while the areas that get dropped or do not work well will be reevaluated or canned.

In the second scenario, which is notoriously hard to do well, OKRs provide a framework to explain the company’s goal(s) and provide enough objectives that can be broken down into smaller components for the many teams involved in making it a reality. The better you can state your goals the easier your teams can figure out what needs to happen and how to get there.

This may seem simplistic — too good to be true, but I’ve found just going through the exercise of either defining OKRs, or reworking current company plans into OKRs to be a highly effective evaluation tool.
