## Managing the 'Service' in SaaS

As a SaaS company grows rapidly success can’t be maintained without the proper services in places. “Customer support is critical in SaaS because of the 'Service' part of it," Shah says. "People need help and you need to provide them genuine support to keep up with your growth.”

### Slack

### Lessons form the first major growth phase:

- Structure your support queue through a triage process
- Choose a toll that you can grow into as your customer base grows
- Give yourself the ability to throttle growth if it has the potential to outstrip your ability to support it

#### Support Triage

- Problem
- Question
- Feedback
- Feature Request

About field

#### Choose a support tool that can handle growth

- Hit our 20x growth moment and realized that we had no sustainable way to manage the support queue
- Resulted in lots of hacks and workarounds and wasted time
- The extra monthly cost of a better tool was more than offset by the cost of the time we lost dealing with the cheaper tool

#### Give yourself the ability to throttle during growth periods

- Realized early on that new user onboarding was the most support-intensive time for a user
- Users were invited to the platform when we were confident we could support them
- Provided a line-skipping mechanism (referrals) for those who weren't keen on waiting for an invite

### Lessons form the second major growth phase:

- Know your PR cycles
- Unless you have some reason to believe that this time will be different, assume it'll be roughly the same as last time
- This does not get any easier
- But it can be more manageable

#### Know your patterns

- When are tickets created?
- How important is it to answer them promptly? Do you have a service that is mission-critical?
- What expectations have you set with your customer base for turnaround time?

### Generic Advice

- Not every support request is a request for product support
- Business decisions do not belong in your support queue
- Product decisions do not belong in your support queue
- You can use support as a shield
- You are problem solvers
- You cannot solve every problem
- Stay focused

## Metrics: More than Meets the Eye

"Most SaaS businesses are subscription businesses where customers can vote with their credit cards on a periodic basis, either monthly or yearly at best. Because of that, the way you measure your business can greatly impact your growth," Shah says.

### 9 Worst Practices in SaaS Metrics

#### 9 Confuse MRR with Cash Inflow (or Bookings or Sales or Revenues)

**MRR:**
- **M**onthly **R**ecurring **R**evenue
- Shows how much revenue you make next month if you don't win any new customers (assuming no churn, no upgrades/downgrades, etc.)
- No 1 SaaS metric. Much more important indicator than bookings or cash inflow (but cash inflow pays the bills!)
- **Example:**
	- 2 customers
	- 1 on a $20/m monthly plan
	- 1 on a $120/y yearly plan
	- MRR = $30

#### 8 Underestimate churn (by mixing up monthly with yearly plans)

No of customers who churned / No of customers who **could have** churned

Including customers who can't cancel in the denominator screws up your churn estimate!

If you include customers who can't churn in your churn calculation, you'll be hit by a bad surprise once they **can** leave!

#### 7 Ignore your cohorts

Cohort analyses are the **only** way to get a good understanding of retention and customer lifetimes

#### 6 Don't track each step of the conversion funnel

Whether you use the age-old AIDA formula:
- Attention
- Interest
- Decision
- Action

Or Dave McOure's "AARRR":
- Acquisition
- Activation
- Retention
- Referral
- Revenue

You have to track the key steps of your conversion funnel and you should be obsessed about improving each of them

#### 5 Mix up visitors to your marketing website with users of your software

This can lead to a weird chart: your visits are going up slowly but surely, but your signups are flat (and here your signup rate goes down)

If you correctly track separate app visits from website visits, turns out your signup rate didn't go down (good news) but you're not growing website traffic (bad news)? which is a very actionable insight.

#### 4 Show CACs on a blended basis only (mixing up paid and non-paid sources of leads)

Example:
- 100 customers at $0 per customer
- 20 customers at $500 per customer
- Average CACs of $83.33, but the average is pretty meaningless

Catch the low-hanging fruits, just don't expect them to scale!

#### 3 Attribute all conversions to your sales team

Find out how well your signups are converting *without* being called by a salesperson.

A/B test and calculate the ROI on your sales investments based on the *conversion uplift.*

#### 2 Assume you're growing exponentially
- True exponential growth is very, very rare in SaaS - requires virality which most SaaS products don't have
- Most SaaS companies grow linearly and with step changes
- Even a modest exponential growth rate of 10% p.m. is very hard to sustain for a longer period of time
- Reading exponential growth into linear growth numbers can lea to wrong conclusions

#### 1 Don't start tracking KPIs until investors request it
- Investors want historic numbers, not just a snapshot
- Many metrics are actionable - they tell you what to focus on, when to invest in acceleration, etc.
- Metrics help you focus your team on what matters most

## Growth: Next Steps
How do you know what areas to focus on for growth? It’s about combining qualitative and quantitative data, Shah says.

Metrics -> Hypothesis -> Experiment -> Act

Metrics = Figure out what to improve
Hypothesis = Make an educated guess
Experiment = Test your guess
Act = Decide what's next

"A solid test hypothesis is an informed solution to a real problem - not an arbitrary guess. The more research and data you have to base your hypothesis on, the better it will be". - Michael Aagaard.

Only 1 out 5 tests win. 4 out of 5 tests cost you money.

Answer key questions for each experiment:

1. Which top metric are we trying to improve?
2. What can you anchor your metric against?
3. What is your hypothesis about why this metric is at x%?
4. What do we expect from this experiment?
5. What was the result and what did we learn from it?

- Prioritize your experiments.
- Don't copy "best practices" blindly.
- Learn what works best for you.

Explore results and make data informed decisions.
