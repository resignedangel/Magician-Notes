#SaaS #metrics #paybackperiod 

It might sound like total Greek at first, but payback period is a simple metric (it is, I promise) that helps businesses keep acquisition, retention, and conversion costs in check. When you spend money to acquire customers, you expect to make that money back ... one day. Payback period tells you how long it’ll take for that to happen and the "gross margin-adjusted" piece is a valuable filter for freemium products.

## (Payback) Time is Money

Imagine you just bought a house and plan to rent it out. You paid a certain amount up front to purchase the property (let's assume you’re not taking out a mortgage) and will collect rent from your tenant every month. If it takes 100 years for you to break even, the property probably wasn’t a great investment. But, if it only takes two months, you'd be crazy not to make more of those investments, right?

For SaaS companies, it's the same situation: we pay up front to acquire a user and if that user ends up becoming a paying customer, they’ll generate value back to the business over time. Knowing whether that’ll take 100 years or two months is crucial because subscription-based business is risky. You’re investing money that you might never see again; customers could churn before you break even and a good chunk of your users will never become paying customers. That’s why SaaS companies aim to get their money back quickly; **a payback period of about 12 months is a good goal.** That way, customers are paying for themselves and becoming profitable within a year.

So, how do you figure out what your payback period is? Easy peasy Divide CAC by your Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) per customer, (**the amount customers pay for your product or service, like “rent” for a property owner.**) If you don’t know what your CAC is, shame on you. There’s a good primer [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34054/The-6-Marketing-Metrics-Your-CEO-Actually-Cares-About-Cheat-Sheet.aspx) for calculating it, but basically it’s just **the sum of what you spend on sales and marketing in a given time period (e.g. advertising, commissions, salaries, overhead) divided by the number of customers you acquired in that same time frame**. After that quick math, you’re left with the number of months it’ll take you to break even ... sort of. This is where payback period gets interesting.

## Money Costs Money

Say you have to pay the electric bill out-of-pocket on the house you bought. Or, maybe you have to spend your own time maintaining the yard or dealing with the tenants. These are real costs that we call costs of goods sold (COGS) and they affect the margin of your property. Though you collect $Y/month on the property, you spend $Z of that to keep things running; you have to factor that into your equation for your payback period to be truly reflective of what your output is. This is where **“gross margin-adjusted”** comes in.

Keeping a product up-and-running and on the cutting edge, especially as your customer base grows, is a big investment. In the SaaS world, our COGS aren’t electric bills or landlord to-dos, but **hosting and customer support**. So, while gross margin-adjusted payback period sounds scary, it’s really just how long it takes to break even given all the costs that go into acquiring customers (not just marketing and sales). Here's what it looks like in a spreadsheet:

ou can see here that the gross margin is 68.8%, so to calculate our gross margin-adjusted payback period, we do the same equation as above only the MRR value should be multiplied by that percentage: 

**200/((240/12)*0.688) = 14.55 **

## Not So Fast, Freemium

For freemium businesses like Sidekick, factoring in gross margin is crucial for two reasons: we spend way less on "traditional" acquisition costs like sales and marketing, and most of users aren't generating any revenue. Naturally, those conditions are going to cause a kink in the payback period plan if we're only looking at CAC and MRR/customer. One approach we like for this scenario is to** determine what the usage breakdown between free and paid users is and to split hosting, and any other COGS, between acquisition and expense.**

In this table, you can see there are line items for hosting and support in two places: under Acquisition Costs and Acquisition Expense. The total cost of hosting, capital expenditure, and support are broken across the two categories according to the ratio of active usage in each of the "Free" (acquisition) and "Paid" buckets.

## Putting Payback to Work

If your payback period is under 12 months, consider investing in and experimenting with new and/or increasingly aggressive acquisition approaches. On the other hand, if payback is getting away from you (18 months or more) you should consider choosing an internal metric that could be weighing you down and optimizing it aggressively. The candidates to hammer on here include: **churn rate, acquisition costs, user or lead conversion rate, and your average sale price (ASP)**. When all the moving pieces are aligned and working, you’ll find your sweet spot.
