## The 4 Part Niche Formula

**Definition of Niche:**

> "Denoting or relating to products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population"

- Targeting a very specific group of people instead of everyone
- If you try to appeal to absolutely everyone you'll likely truly appeal to no one.

**Your Skills -> Your Passion -> Their Needs -> Viability**

Imagine your ideal client walks through the door right now.

She offers you a blank check to help her / solve her problem.

What problem are you solving?
...and how are you going to do it?

Lay out the specifics.

Remember, this is your imagination - there are no limitations.

Next, it's time to imagine you've been asked to speak on stage in front of 10,000 people.

They are so excited to learn from you. It's going to be recorded, it's going to bring in floods of sales... it's a game changer.

What's the topic or title of your talk?

(There are no limitations here)
