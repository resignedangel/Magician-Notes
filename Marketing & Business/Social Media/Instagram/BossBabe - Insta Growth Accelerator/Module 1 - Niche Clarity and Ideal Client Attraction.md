## The 4 Part Niche Formula

**Definition of Niche:**

> "Denoting or relating to products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population"

- Targeting a very specific group of people instead of everyone
- If you try to appeal to absolutely everyone you'll likely truly appeal to no one.

**Your Skills -> Your Passion -> Their Needs -> Viability**

Imagine your ideal client walks through the door right now.

She offers you a blank check to help her / solve her problem.

What problem are you solving?
...and how are you going to do it?

Lay out the specifics.

Remember, this is your imagination - there are no limitations.

Next, it's time to imagine you've been asked to speak on stage in front of 10,000 people.

They are so excited to learn from you. It's going to be recorded, it's going to bring in floods of sales... it's a game changer.

What's the topic or title of your talk?

(There are no limitations here)

## Client Avatar & Transformation

### Your Reflection
- Which top 10 people do you enjoy following?
- How did you find them?
- What was it about their profiles that attracted you to follow?
- Do they relate to you in any way? If so, how?
- What do they share that you enjoy consuming?
- How does this make you think about the way you create content for your ideal clients?
- What could you be doing more of to start getting discovered by your ideal clients?

### Your Ideal Client Avatar

- You should know everything about them: their routines, relationships, struggles, passions, hobbies, diet, location...
- The more you truly understand them, the more that your content will speak to them
- You should also get clear on who they're following and looking up to right now. These people are going to show you the blueprint for creating content for your ideal client.
- What 3 things they all have in common?
- This is the basis on which you can build a community for your ideal clients
- How can you deeply relate to your ideal client?
- Do you have story that explains how you went from where they are or what they're struggling with, to experiencing the transformation that you know they desire?

### Your Competition

- Consider 5 of your strongest competitors.
- What niches are they in?
- What is their main value?
- What content gets the most engagement?
- What does their audience seems to want the most?
- What sets you apart and makes you different?

### Client Transformation

> **A:** Where they are now, struggling with their pain points, ready to move to B -> **B:** Where they'll be after working with you or buying your product.

**A:** One year into their first business and unable to maintain steady sales each month, currently they're between 2K and 4K monthly -> **B:** They are now consistently at 4K months and finding it easy to hit that number. They are now able to focus on other areas in their business.

**A:** They have healthy breakfast and dinners bur are always stuck for healthy lunch option. This results in them making poor choices - having low energy and not being at weight goal they desire -> **B:** They now have a very easy lunch option and feel prepared and on top of their game. Their routine now feels complete and their energy is spilling over into other areas of their life. They are at their goal weight.

**A:** They are in business but are feeling really lonely and like no one around them truly understands what they are doing. It's making them sad and lose motivation for their business. -> **B:** They now have a strong group of girlfriends who they check in with on a weekly basis and talk through their wins and struggles. They feel supported, happy and motivated.

However, the work starts before your client is at A...

#### Pre-Transformation

Your work is to help your ideal clients to see that their situation does have a fix and that you can help. You want to create content that inspires your ideal client to get into the mindset of wanting "more" or wanting support.

### Your Transformation Content Triangle (TCT)

You want to create content around your transformation in 3 ways:

1. Content to move people to the **"A"** status where they're open to learning more. Influence them to think differently and shift their mindset/beliefs.
2. Content for people at **A** to show them how to move forward with **B** - i.e. your sell. Show them what specific transformation you can help with and invite them to move forward.
3. Content from people at **B** to show **pre-A** what is possible. Share your testimonials so it makes logical sense for people to move from **A** to **B**, and it inspires people from **pre-A** to think differently and enter **A**.

### Transformational Content Considerations

- What are 3-5 things your ideal clients say when they're ready to begin working with you or buying your product?
- What are the main mindsets or beliefs your ideal clients share when they're ready?
- How would your ideal client describe the transformation she received from working with you/your product?
- How your ideal client feel when they've experienced this transformation?
- What new mindsets or beliefs will your ideal client have about themselves or the world around them?
- List 5-10 questions or concerns that your ideal client will have before they take the leap from A to B.
- List 5-10 accomplishments or milestones that your ideal client will reach during her transformation journey with you/your product.
