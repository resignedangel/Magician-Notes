In our industry, we refer to storytelling as content marketing. How we execute on content varies whether we’re a B2B or B2C business. Here's some quick context on each variation:

- **B2B: BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS**
“A good B2B content strategy often boils down to simply being the most insightful source of information on the work you do.”

- **B2C: BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER**
“B2C content marketing is often focused on the topics consumers care about; a good B2C content marketing aims to entertain.”

## What is B2C2B?

B2C2B stands for **business-to-consumer-to-business**. According to venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz, B2C2B means *“winning hearts and minds of the intermediate consumer, the employees of a company.”*

Here's a visual of how it works, adapted from Tomasz' site:

Our growth approach for Sidekick is B2C2B. Sidekick is a freemium product that tracks your emails and surfaces helpful contact information right in your inbox.

*Imagine this situation:*

You work in sales. What feels like every month, some new software is being forced upon you from top leadership. It takes you weeks to get onboarded and months to fully integrate the software into your flow. You feel controlled and aren't happy with the product being forced on you.

*Now imagine this situation:*

You work in sales. The rep sitting next to you is hustling through emails. You ask him what his secret is and he says Sidekick. You navigate to the product website and try it yourself. You fall in love with it yourself. You tell your friends in sales. Pretty soon everyone on your team is using it and succeeding with it. With the whole team's success, you make a case to your manager to upgrade to premium for unlimited usage. The results are so good he does. Pretty soon other sales teams at the org want the same success.

And like that, an entire company is now **paying** for Sidekick.

That's what B2C2B should look like - very natural, but strategic word-of-mouth product adoption straight from the end-user. In fact, this is the [model behind companies such as LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/biggest-b2c2b-company-world-tomasz-tunguz), Expensify, Slack, and more. 

## So, how do we employ a content strategy in this new B2C2B framework?
On the Sidekick content team, we believe it comes down to four core principles.

### 1 COMMIT TO A HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL PROCESS

Ladies of the 90s (and gentlemen who had to witness), do you remember the phenomenon of this "one-size-fits-all" popcorn shirt that actually didn't look good on anyone at all? 

From where I see it, **one-size-fits-all is to fashion what best practices are to content: a bunch of BS. **

While best practices can inspire us, **every decision we make should stem from an experiment.** During my time as a one-woman content machine for Sidekick, all my research of the "must-have" content channels pointed to:

- business blog
- linkedin pulse
- gated ebooks
- slideshare decks
- SEO web pages

With our experimental model in mind, I began testing each. Let's use LinkedIn Pulse as an example to review what this looked like: 

**Experiment: **
To understand if LinkedIn Pulse can become a scalable channel for driving activated users for Sidekick.

**Hypothesis:** 
Based on what we could gather, if this experiment is successful, we predict it would add 201 new activated users because -    

- *31,000 views x 0.65% conversion rate = 201 activated users.    

- *31,000 views = avg # of views a post from influencer program .65% = rough avg %of people who activate after reading getsidekick.com/blog

**Strategy: **
Since there was little understanding of this channel, we tested with an efficient, low investment way to garner some data about ROI. Since it was only available for individual users (not brands), our experiment involved republishing previously successful content under Mark Roberge’s profile with the following tactics:

1. text-based CTA at end of post
2. intro copy linking back to sidekick blog
3. click-to-tweet links
4. landing-page style post
5. hyperlink images
6. image/button CTAs

**Performance:**

**Results:** 

![[Pasted image 40.png]]
We also generated 17 new blog subscribers. 

**Conclusion: **
Currently, LinkedIn Publishing has not shown enough positive viability as a core content channel for Sidekick.

With limited resources, we get better ROI on our time other channels. We may use LinkedIn to help support other goals - such as getting an offer more attention or recycling some content.


This experimental framework guided us through every channel we attempted to make work for the B2C2B funnel. Here were **the results for all the aforementioned channels:**

- **business blog** - a business blog is at the core of most content strategies. While we had to find our own strategy to break through the clutter, as discussed here, our experimental approach guided us along the way. 

- **linkedin pulse** - as shown above, this channel was one that did not prove enough value to be included in our playbook.

- **gated ebooks** - we'll be learning more about why this did not work in principle two. 

- **slideshare decks** - a big channel for the Sidekick strategy. We've created a collection of guides that return us with new Sidekick users monthly. 

- **SEO web pages** - a big win for our B2C2B content strategy, more to be shared on this in principle three. 

By August 2014, we had a strong grasp on the channels that would sit on our B2C2B toolkit. But now it was time to figure out how to actually measure our success here, which brings us to principle two ... but first a review of this one. 


> Principle Review: Avoid blindly following best practices and focus instead on uncovering what works best for your own audience.


### 2 SEEK EXCELLENCE THROUGH AUTHENTIC GROWTH

Most growth teams seek authentic growth through active usage. This typically is defined by either DAU, WAU, or MAU:

- **DAU: DAILY ACTIVE USER**
unique amount of users who are "active" within a day
- **WAU: WEEKLY ACTIVE USER**
unique amount of users who are "active" within a week
- **MAU: MONTHLY ACTIVE USER**
unique amount of users who are "active" within a month

We measure Sidekick in WAUs. We use a set of criteria that shows if users are getting value from our product every week. That core metric helps us monitor the success of our B2C2B growth.
